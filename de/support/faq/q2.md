The default IP address of all metraTec devices is 192.168.2.239. If your host device (laptop, PC, etc.) happens to be in the same subnet (i.e. it also has an address that starts with 192.168.2.x) you can use the internal webserver on port 80 to change the IP address.

If you are in a different subnet, use our TUC Config Manager to change the IP to something else even across subnet borders.

The default password for our devices is "tucadmin" unless specified otherwise during your order.
