In many cases, your application will require an HF antenna that is not available off the shelf. Either the antennas available are too small and don't allow the reading ranges needed or they are too big to fit into the space available. In other cases, they just need to have an individual shape. In these cases, you do not need to abandon your RFID integration project. We would like to offer you an RFID solution while you can concentrate solely on the development of your projects. To make this possible metraTec offers a new development service - the antenna design service. Regardless of how unusual your requirements for an HF antenna are - we will do our best to satisfy your needs. We have extensive design experience with antennas ranging from 10 mm x 10 mm (0.4" x 0.4") to 500 mm x 750 mm (20" x 30") and in many different shapes. Currently, our antennas are being used under very different environmental conditions - one customer's application is at 120 °C (approx. 250 °F) regularly, another has vibrations and rain, requiring a robust design and high ingress protection class. Whether they are to be flexible and thin or stiff and robust - for every case we will find an optimal solution for you.

Besides our extensive experience in HF engineering and design we also have access to the necessary measurement equipment and - if needed - to state of the art simulation software to simulate complete field distributions. Thanks to our mechanics and electronics workshop we can produce prototypes and small production run in house quickly.

As metraTec is one of the few companies worldwide who designs and manufactures both HF and UHF antennas in house we also have extensive experience in UHF antenna design. This allows us to offer you antenna customization to your specific needs also for UHF antennas. Should you require custom housing for your antenna please talk with us - depending on order quantities we can offer you different materials, production methods (and associated costs), finishes and the like.
