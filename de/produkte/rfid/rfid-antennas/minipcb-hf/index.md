The metraTec PCB Antenna Family includes a range of printed circuit board antennas for 13.56 MHz (HF RFID). With the three standard versions MiniPCB (50 x 96 mm) you can realize a variety of applications. With the right reader - eg. metraTecâ€˜s QuasarMX - and tag, you can expect a read range of up to 100, which covers most scenarios.

If you need other dimensions, we offer an antenna design service for PCB antennas, as well. For a fixed price, we design an antenna in any shape from 5x5c mm to 50x50 mm and with any connector you like.

If required, we can also produce flexible versions of our PCB antennas. These can be integrated into even the smallest volumes and are often easier to mount.
