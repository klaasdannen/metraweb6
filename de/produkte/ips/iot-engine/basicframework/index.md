The IoT Engine provides a web-based Dashboard, which all other components use to display their information.  Here you are able to monitor and manage the entire operating status of the system. The IoT Engine can be used from any modern browser, including tablet and mobile phone based browsers. It includes a user management (username/password) with different user groups and flexible access rights and the customer can configure rights as required. All configuration changes are logged to a secure log file (audit log) that allows a full roll-back of any change if necessary.

The IoT Engine also manages system updates with a graphical updates system that allows each plugin to be updated separately with a simple drag and drop in the browser. In case of problems with a component, the previous versions can be restored as well directly inside the web dashboard. All actions, hardware and software problems and events are automatically logged and can be reviewed via the browser.
