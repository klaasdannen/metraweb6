- question: "Where do I find the USB drivers for metraTec devices?"
  answer: "USB drivers are not needed anymore because they are included in modern operating systems. For more exotic systems you might need to download the driver directly from FTDIChip.com."
- question: "What is the difference between RFID and NFC?"
  answer: "Often these two terms are used identically, even if they are actually different things. RFID (radio frequency identification) is the generic term for the entire technology, i.e. passive transponders and corresponding read/write devices. NFC (Nearfield Communication) is based on RFID, but describes a sub-form. Here, the format of the data is also defined and the type of communication. So all NFC products are also RFID products, but not vice versa. If you are looking for a device to read and write data in an industrial NFC-compatible way, our QuasarMF is the right product for you."
- question: "What is the default IP and password of a metraTec Ethernet device?"
  answer: "The default IP address of all metraTec devices is 192.168.2.239. If your host device (laptop, PC, etc.) happens to be in the same subnet (i.e. it also has an address that starts with 192.168.2.x) you can use the internal webserver on port 80 to change the IP address. If you are in a different subnet, use our TUC Config Manager to change the IP to something else even across subnet borders. The default password for our devices is 'tucadmin' unless specified otherwise during your order."
- question: "What is the difference between IPS and IPS+?"
  answer: "The metraTec IPS (Indoor Positioning System) exists in two varieties: The older 'classic' version is known as IPS and is based on a 2.4GHz IEEE 802.15.4 signal. The beacons send their ID and the receiver pick up this data and use RSSI value (signal strength) to estimate the distance. This can be used to do a simple presence detection and zone based localization. The advantage are cheap beacons with extremely long battery lifes of up to 10 years. The IPS+ on the other hand uses ultrawideband (UWB) technology to locate the becaons. This has a much better accuracy of up to 0.5m but comes with higher costs and more energy consumption. Both systems have their uses and it depends on your exact situation which system is better suited for you."
