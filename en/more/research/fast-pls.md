Fast secure will show that the concepts of security at the transmission layer can be implemented on hardware available today. This will create the basis for secure and fast communication for many subprojects in fast Cluster and beyond.

Wireless fading channels are not a load, but guarantee "perfect security" by using information theoretical results. By the principle of the "physically uncloneable function", such as a reciprocal wireless transmission channel, a unique secure key can be generated between two communication partners, which is tap-proof.
