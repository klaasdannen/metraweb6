In July 2017 metraTec received the funding for the R&D project "Augmented Reality Assisted 3D Laparoscopy (LapAR)". Since then the company has been researching new methods to support minimally invasive surgery using "Augmented Reality" methods together with 2tainment GmbH and the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. For this purpose, important information such as the location of a tumor is to be directly displayed in the 3D image to the surgeon during a laparoscopic procedure.

metraTec's task in this project is to localize the laparoscope, which is important for the display of the data. The use of motion sensors and optical flow methods will be tested for their suitability. On the other hand, the target region has to be localized, which will be done with the help of magnetic tracking.

The project involves three employees and will be carried out between July 2017 and September 2020. The project is funded by the European Union together with the Investitionsbank Sachsen-Anhalt within the framework of the "Research and Development" funding programme.
