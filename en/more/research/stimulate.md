Since 2013, metraTec GmbH is a member of the STIMULATE Verein e.V. and is involved in the research campus STIMULATE. metraTec is engaged in the research and development of electromagnetic tracking systems for the tracking of implants in the human body.

In close cooperation with the chair of Medical Telematics and Medical Technology at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg, a prototype of an RFID tracking system for locating intracorporeal markers was developed in 2013/14. In the course of the cooperation on this project two master theses were developed.

Since 2014 metraTec is engaged in the development of a wireless tracking system for medical instruments. The goal is to merge data from a novel electromagnetic tracking system with data from other sensors in order to increase the accuracy and immunity of the entire system. This project has so far resulted in a master's thesis and one employee is working as an external PhD student at the Chair of Medical Telematics and Medical Technology.
