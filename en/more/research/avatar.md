The exchange of surgical experience and expertise is still very traditional today, often at conferences, through the presentation of surgical videos and by organizing mutual visits. Complex manual skills and surgical techniques have to be newly developed, trained and passed on to the next generation of surgeons or specialist colleagues. With the methods currently used, this exchange is very costly and time-consuming.

In the joint project, VR interaction and visualization techniques are being developed to improve the exchange of experience and competence between medical professionals. In a virtual reality, several users are to train collaboratively - simultaneously and in real time. The positions of locally distributed persons will be determined using hybrid tracking technologies based on ultra-wideband technologies and inertial sensor technology. On this basis, VR training scenarios are designed, implemented in a multi-user communication system and clinically evaluated over the distance.

The innovation of the project is the combination of collaborative interaction and visualization techniques with hybrid tracking technologies in an advanced multi-user communication system. The project results should provide a basis for the development of future VR-based communication and simulation systems in medicine.
