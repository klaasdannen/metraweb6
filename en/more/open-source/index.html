<h1>Open Source Projects</h1>

<p>We love to use open source software for development and as part of our products. This includes Yocto Linux, the Zephyr RTOS and ROS for controlling robots. Therefore, we also contribute some of our work by open sourcing our own projects or by committing to existing projects.</p>

<p>You can find our own projects including some forks in our public Github repository at <a href="https://github.com/metratec" target="_blank">https://github.com/metratec</a></p>
