Normally the driver should install itself automatically via Windows Update under Windows 8 / 10 (sometimes it takes a while). This requires an internet connection.

Otherwise, please disconnect the device once and download the driver from <http://www.ftdichip.com/Drivers/CDM/CDM21226_Setup.zip> and follow the instructions. If this also does not solve your problem, please contact our support team.
