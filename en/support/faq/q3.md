title: "What is the difference between RFID and NFC?"
type: "faq-en"

Often these two terms are used identically, even if they are actually different things. RFID (radio frequency identification) is the generic term for the entire technology, i.e. passive transponders and corresponding read/write devices. NFC (Nearfield Communication) is based on RFID, but describes a sub-form. Here, the format of the data is also defined and the type of communication. So all NFC products are also RFID products, but not vice versa.

If you are looking for a device to read and write data in an industrial NFC-compatible way, our QuasarMF is the right product for you.
