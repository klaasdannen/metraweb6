After some years of stagnation, the new metraTec website goes online today. While the previous site had a classic Typo3 backend with database, this new version uses current web technologies like React and Gatsby. This gives you - the visitors - a better user experience due to faster loading times and better usability even on smartphones.

In addition to the technical improvements, you can still find all information about our products in the field of RFID, indoor positioning and Internet-of-Things technology on our website. In addition to hardware, you will now also find information about our software product, the IoT Engine, which allows you to link data from any device to other systems, such as your ERP system.
