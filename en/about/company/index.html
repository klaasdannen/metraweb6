<p>
  We at metraTec firmly believe in a trend we called "electronization
  of everyday life" that today would be called the "Internet of
  Things". While in the past the use of electronics was limited to a
  few selected devices like computers, telephones or calculators,
  today more and more devices feature specialized electronics.
</p>
<p>
  To create new features, these devices will need sense to interact
  with their environment: They have to identify other objects,
  calculate their location in a building, share data with other
  devices and all of this with mobile power supplies that are charged
  wireless without cables or connectors. To make this vision come
  true, we develop wireless electronics for identification,
  localization, communication and wireless power transmission to give
  tomorrow's devices a future or in short:
