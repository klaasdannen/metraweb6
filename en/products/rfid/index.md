# Wireless Identification
***

RFID technology is used for the unique and contactless identification of objects or persons via radio. RFID systems are widely used today and are used for various applications. Especially the possibility to read RFID transponders over a certain distance is an enormous advantage over alternative identification systems.

## Passive RFID

The great advantage of passive RFID technology is that the transponders used do not require a battery. The transponder is powered by the electromagnetic field emitted by the reader. Accordingly, the use of passive RFID technologies makes it possible to design transponders very small and cost-effective. At present, passive technologies mainly use communication standards at 13.56MHz (HF RFID) and 868MHz (UHF RFID).

## Active RFID

In contrast to passive systems, active systems have a battery. This allows reading ranges of up to hundreds of meters. The reliability and security of communication also increases, as more complex protocols can be used. In addition to pure identification, locating and sensor functions can also be integrated, such as in the metraTec Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS). In active metraTec systems mainly nodes with transmission frequencies at 2.4 GHz or ultra wide band positioning systems at 6 GHz are used.

metraTec GmbH's range of RFID hardware includes readers, multiplexers and antennas, thus enabling the connection of transponders and software.
metraTec GmbH offers most of its products both as end devices, which are primarily used in production and logistics, and as OEM modules, which are mainly integrated into other devices. In addition to single components we also offer complete solutions for individual industries. metraTec GmbH cooperates with partners on the integration and software side to offer complete industry solutions. In addition, customer-specific developments are possible if existing technologies do not meet customer requirements. More information about the respective products can be found on the product pages.
