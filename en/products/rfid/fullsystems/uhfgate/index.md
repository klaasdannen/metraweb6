The UHF Person Gate consists of a mechanical gate made from aluminum into which all necessary RFID hardware has been integrated. Using the special form of the sides, the RF field is always reflected to the inside of the gate which ensures optimal field distribution and as a consequence optimal reading results even in "difficult" applications that include metal or liquids.

Potential applications are event monitoring and ticket control (using cheap UHF tickets) and even applications in logistics where goods are transported manually.

Besides a human sized gate we also offer individually designed UHF gates in other dimensions. We have realized projects to read out pallet trucks, forklifters or even entire trucks. Usually we try to keep the gate as small as possible for the application to get the best read rates.
