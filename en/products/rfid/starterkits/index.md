# Product Overview Starter Kits
***

You'd like to try out RFID without investing much time or money? Then our starter kits are the right choice for you. Each kit includes all components you need to set up a complete RFID system. And with the free software you start reading and writing tag data in minutes after opening the box.

At the moment there are three different kits available for RFID at the HF RFID frequency (13.56 MHz) with varying read ranges from 100 to 350 mm.

If your project requires a higher read range, UHF RFID might be the right technology for you. With our UHF Starter Ktit you will get a read range of up to 4 m with the included antenna.
