The DeskID ISO is a compact HF RFID Reader/Writer for RFID applications in the office or even at home. Typical application scenarios include customer identification (e.g. in fitness studios), configuration of wireless access control systems as well as (in the near future) reading data from biometric IDs or health insurance cards.

The slim, well designed housing fits on every desktop and gives every PC user the possibility to read and write transponders which communicate according to ISO15693. Reading range varies between 50 and 100 mm, depending on tag type. The device is connected to the PC using a normal USB cable which is also used to power the device (no separate power supply necessary).

With the help of the user software included with the device, supported transponders can be read and written to. Also included with the device is a programming library (DLL for Microsoft Visual Studio) you can use to write your own applications within a short period of time without prior knowledge of RFID.
