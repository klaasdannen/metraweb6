The QuasarMR1 is a mid range RFID reader operating in the HF frequency range (13.56 MHz). With its RF power it is able to read tags from a distance of up to 400 mm (16") with a suitable combination of RFID tag and antenna. To communicate with the rest of the world the QuasarMR1 has a USB connection and an optional ethernet interface. Both are addressed via a virtual COM port or via TCP in case of an ethernet connection.

Additionally there are 8 general purpose IO pins, which can be controlled via the reader software. These pins can be used to control external devices, such as multiplexers (e.g. our hfMux Multiplexers), alarms or other peripherals.

The reader supports a broad variety of protocols, including ISO15693 and ISO18000-3 as well as selected proprietary protocols.
