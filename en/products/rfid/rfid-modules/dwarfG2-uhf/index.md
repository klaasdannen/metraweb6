UHF RFID at 868/915 MHz is more and more replacing the classic HF RFID technology at 13,56 MHz due to a high potential read range and cheaper RFID transponders. This trends leads to the fact that more and more developers have to work with UHF electronics, which is not an easy topic if you haven't studied communication technology. A very simple way to integrate UHF RFID into your device without risk and shortest time-to-market is to use metraTec's DwarfG2 UHF SMD module.

The compact module can be soldered directly to your mainboard as an SMD component. If you want to integrate it into a vending machine, label printer or other device with a embedded PC, you can also use a normal wire connector. With only 36x40 mm it fits into any machine with virtually no heat developed due to the automatic power save mode. Nonetheless, you will get a read range of up to 500mm with the right antenna and transponder. Another special feature is the high speed of the firmware, when reading and writing data to a tag (approx 100ms for a 96bit EPC).
