Some RFID applications place higher demands on data security, e.g. applications in the field of e-payment or ticketing. Here, transponders according to ISO14443A or MIFARE® technology are often used. The QR14 plug-in module is suitable for all these applications where transponders need to be read or written in a space-saving and cost-effective manner. The module supports the protocols MIFARE Classic and MIFARE Ultralight®. Furthermore, the QR14 plug-in module can also be used to read and write NFC chips of NFC type 2.

As a plug-in module, it can be easily integrated into your own electronic assemblies and delivers good RFID performance. With the integrated antenna, a reading range of up to 50 mm is possible. The communication to the microcontroller is done via UART, so that an integration can be easily implemented.

As with the QR15 module, the UDB1 development board can be used for development, which ensures a simplified start into the technology.
