If you want to integrate RFID technology into existing devices to check consumables, find countfeited spare parts in a machine or to identify users, you sometimes don't have the space on your PCB for a complete reader. Often you only have few square inch of available space to place all the RFID functionality you need. For these cases, the Dwarf15 RFID Module is just the right product.

With a size of only 18 x 32 mm the module sets new standard for RFID reader miniaturization. Despite its size, the module has a performance comparable to much bigger RFID readers. With the right antenna you can even get a read range of 150 mm.

With the use of these production ready SMD modules you get a tested hardware and firmware with an extremely short time to market. If you need a different form factor or new features there is always the possibility for a customized module. For high volume applications it is also possible to get a licence for design and firmware at attractive conditions.
