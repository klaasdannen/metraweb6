The QR15 is an RFID reader module for all applications where RFID tags that work according to ISO15693 (like ICode, Tag-It and many more) have to be scanned with a small and cost effective module. With the integrated antenna a read range of up to 70 mm is possible.

The small module can be easily integrated into your own board and gives you an exceptional performance (up to 100 tag reads/sec) without the need to develop your own firmware and RF electronics. The module communicates via a UART connection with almost any microcontroller as well as various converter chips.

By using this plugin module you get proven hard- and firmware with an unbeatable time to market. The module has a modular approval for FCC/IC certification and ETSI measurements are also available on request. For the quickest start into a new project, we suggest our QR15 Embedded RFID Starter Kit.
