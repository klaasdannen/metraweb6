This plugin manages and monitors all devices which are necessary for a typical application with passive RFID. The plugin is used to configure the readers and readpoints and checks the status of the hardware (e.g. running). Both, HF and UHF readers from metraTec as well as other manufacturers are supported by the plugin.

All information about the reader and readpoints are logged and displayed in form of a table within the dashboard. It also displays which tags are currently present at a readpoint. All tables are searchable and can be exported in MS Excel or other external tools.

An example of the application is the permanent inventory of a warehouse, which is monitored and controlled with the help of the IoT Engine. The plugin can also be used to control complete UHF tunnels or gates with multiple antennas in one spot including filtering, de-doubling and writing transponder data.
