The QuasarLR is an HF long range RFID reader/writer for demanding industrial applications, where high reading reliability, high read ranges and extensive special tag features are needed.

Highlights include an RF power of up to 4W which allows a read range of up to 600 mm with the right antenna (e.g. our Lambda-40 Loop Antenna). This allows even difficult applications directly at conveyor belts, in production machinery and in laundry applications.

The communication to the host system is done via USB or an optional Ethernet port. Other interfaces, such as WiFi, RS485 or even Fieldbus technology are available on request. To facilitate its integration into machines and to allow ease of control via PLCs the device offers optically isolated 24 V DC Inputs and Outputs.

Integration into IT systems based on Windows is supported by a .NET DLL as well as a Java SDK which come with the device free of charge. A demo software with a comprehensive set of features allows easy testing of the device.
