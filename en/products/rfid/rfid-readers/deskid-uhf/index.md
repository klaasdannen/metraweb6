The DeskID UHF is a compact and well-priced RFID reader/writer working at 868 MHz (UHF RFID, EU). Its main use is to read and write data to EPC Gen 2 transponders directly from your PC or laptop. Thus, the device is a handy tool for all UHF applications for testing tags, writing an EPC or just debug your UHF gate.

The slim, well designed housing fits on every desktop and is connected to the PC using a normal USB cable which is also used to power the device (no separate power supply necessary). The read range is between 100 and 300 mm, depending on the type of transponder used. You can also read several transponder simultaneously (anti collision mode).

With the help of the user software included with the device, supported transponders can be read and written to. Also included with the device is a programming library (DLL for Microsoft Visual Studio) you can use to write your own applications within a short period of time without prior knowledge of RFID. Using the easy to learn low level ASCII protocol you can also connect the device to other systems, e.g. an embedded PC or even a PLC.
