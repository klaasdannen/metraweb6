With the progressive use of UHF RFID in logistics, transponders must be scanned at more and more points in the process. The use of a classic hand-held scanner is not always optimal here. The devices are often bulky and require the employee to have one hand free for operation.

With the BraceID RFID Wristband by metraTec there is an alternative that does not interrupt the process. For the first time, the mobile device allows UHF transponders to be used without interrupting the
actual activity of the logistics employee. The lightweight device (less than 120g) can be worn directly on the arm, BraceID RFID wristband completely without fatigue of the employees. The operation is carried out via touch sensors or is fully automated by a Software controlled. The wristband is equipped with an internal UHF RFID module by metraTec as well as a power saving radio module for communication with suitable gateways. This way the existing WLAN is not burdened and the battery in the device lasts for over
2,000 scans.

In addition to the pure scan function, the user can receive direct feedback on his actions. This can be done via one of the three LEDs, a built-in vibration alarm or a beeper for acoustic feedback. The main module can be separated from the base so that several employees can share one device.
