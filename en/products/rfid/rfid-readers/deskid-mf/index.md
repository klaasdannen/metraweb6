The DeskID MF is an especially compact HF RFID reader and writer for office RFID applications. Typical scenarios for using the DeskID MF are customer management applications (e.g. in the gym), configuring of door access systems or customer cards based on the common protocols MIFARE Classic®, MIFARE Ultralight®.

The low profile, beautiful housing looks great on any desktop and enables every PC user to read and write RFID tags and cards that work according to the MIFARE protocol (as long as they are not protected by passwords). Reading range is approximately 50 to 70 mm. The device is connected to the computer via USB and is also USB powered.

Using Windows software that ships with the device, transponders can be scanned, written, read and erased accordingly. There is also a version available for reading tags according to ISO 15693 which is called DeskID ISO.
