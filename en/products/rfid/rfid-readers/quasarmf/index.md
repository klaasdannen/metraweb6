The QuasarMF is an industrial RFID Reader for transponders which communicate using the ISO14443A and the MIFARE® protocols MIFARE Classic®, MIFARE Ultralight®. It is one of a few readers using MIFARE technology that have a single-ended antenna output which allows to use any HF RFID antenna instead of specially designed MIFARE antennas. This makes it even possible to connect the reader to a multiplexer and read tags from several antennas sequentially.

The communication options include USB as well as Ethernet. To facilitate its integration into machines and to allow ease of control via PLCs the device offers optically isolated 24 V IOs.

Integration into IT systems based on Windows is supported by a free demo software with a comprehensive set of features that allows easy testing of the device.
