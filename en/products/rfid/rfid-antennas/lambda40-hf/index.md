The metraTec Lambda40 is an RFID antenna for HF systems with an operating frequency of 13.56 MHz. With its size of 400 x 400 mm it can handle an RF output of up to 4 W per- mitting reading ranges of up to 600 mm (approx. 2 ft) with a suitable reader. Its robust metal structure and the water-proof IP65 housing make it well suited for rough industrial environments like factory floors, laundries or shipping departments.

The antenna works with many long range readers on the market and has been tested with models from several manufacturers. In addition to the standard size, custom sized versions in almost any size are possible. Limits are only set by the power of the RFID reader as well as local regulations regarding field strength. Please contact our sales team for any questions on this issue.
