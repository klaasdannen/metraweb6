The Echo-6P is a compact circular UHF RFID antenna for the European frequency range at 868 MHz. With an antenna gain of 6.5 dBic and an opening angle of approx. 84Â° you can operate this antenna with up to 33 dBm ERP. This will give you a read range of up to 6 m with normal UHF transponders.

The dimensions of the compact housing are 160 x 165 x 30 mm (plus antenna connector at the bottom). This connector is available in an SMA version as well as an R-TNC version. The latter can be supplied in an IP65 housing (dust and water proof).

In the back the housing is closed by a solid aluminum plane which shields the antenna against unwanted influences from the surrounding environment. The plane has riveted threads which can be used to mount the antenna with any VESA compatible mount.
