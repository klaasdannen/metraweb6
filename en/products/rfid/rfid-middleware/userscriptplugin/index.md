With the Userscript-Plugin you can create your own scripts to trigger a specialized action at a certain event of the middleware. With this plugin the IoT Engine can be tailored to the needs of the application and integrate the necessary logic without having to change the source code of the software. To do this, you write scripts using Javascript that are executed when an event is fired, e.g. when a transponder is scanned, when a beacon leaves an area or when external data arrives.
