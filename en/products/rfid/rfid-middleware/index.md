# RFID Middleware "IoT Engine"
***

In order to operate a complete RFID system, much more is required than just the hardware, such as readers and antennas. At least as important is the software that drives, configures and monitors the devices (middleware). Basically, all metraTec products have open interfaces and each software developer can control the devices himself. However, this is rarely neither the fastest nor the cheapest solution. As an alternative, metraTec offers its own middleware: the metraTec IoT Engine.

With this "engine for the Internet of Things" you get a complete framework, which is already in use for years and large and small projects. The focus of the software is on modularity. The basic system provides only a few basic functions, such as user and rights management, a graphical web interface and logging functionality. All other functions can be added via plug-ins. So you get exactly the functions you need, without an overloaded interface and without unnecessary costs.

On the following subpages we introduce you to the individual plugins and their functions. If you miss something, we would be happy to add a customer-specific plugin to the IoT engine. Basically, you even have the possibility to develop your own plugins with the IoT Engine SDK, which are loaded and managed directly by our software.
