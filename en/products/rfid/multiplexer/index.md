# RFID Multiplexer - one Reader, many Antennas
***

In many cases when setting up an RFID system it is not desirable to connect each and every antenna directly to a reader as this might mean having to operate a very large number of readers. To reduce complexity and hardware costs for readers dramatically, the use of a multiplexer can make sense. A multiplexer is a switch that switches the antennas connected to the reader, allowing to connect up to 16 antennas to one reader. In cases in which reading an antenna e.g. every 500 milliseconds is enough this approach can save hardware costs for readers which are often the most expensive item in an RFID system. Also, only one reader has to be controlled by the host which reduces system integration effort significantly.

This is why metraTec has developed and currently offers the world's largest portfolio of RFID multiplexers. We have multiplexers for both HF and UHF applications in the "low power" and "high power" ranges.
