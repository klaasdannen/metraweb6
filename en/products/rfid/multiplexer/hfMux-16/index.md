The hfMux-16 is a 16x RFID multiplexer for HF systems with 13.56 MHz operating frequency. It enables the operation of up to 16 antennas on a single RFID reader. This makes it possible to set up complex reading devices with low hardware costs and little effort, as only a single reader has to be purchased and controlled.

In the current version of the device, the most frequent customer suggestions have been taken up and implemented: The multiplexer is now housed in a housing that is easier to mount, has status LEDs for the active port and runs on 24V DC. There are also two versions available, the MP version for switching signals up to 2W and the HP version for signals up to 4W.

The device works independently of the antenna and reader manufacturer and can therefore be used flexibly and across the board. The compatibility of the multiplexers has already been tested in the laboratory and in practice with a large number of available RFID readers from various manufacturers.

In the new version, the multiplexers are controlled via optically isolated 24V IOs. These can be set e.g. by our QuasarMX, the QuasarMF and most other RFID readers. Alternatively, control directly via a PLC or Bus Terminal is also possible if use in an automation environment is planned.
