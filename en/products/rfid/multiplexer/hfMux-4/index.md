The hfMux-4 is our 4 port RFID multiplexer for HF systems with an operating frequency of 13.56 MHz and a maximum power of 2 W (in the -MP version) or 4 W (in the -HP version). It allows connecting up to four antennas to a single RFID reader. This reduces system complexity and setup costs in cases where many antennas are needed and also lowers hardware system costs as the number of readers needed decreases dramatically. The housing is suited for wall mounting and status LEDs show which antenna port is currently active. The device is powered using a standard 24V DC power supply.

The multiplexer works irrespective of the manufacturer of the readers and antennas used. Compatibility of the product with hardware from other manufacturers has been tested both in our lab and in customer applications with a variety of other reader brands.

The multiplexer is controlled with optically isolated 24V IOs. These can be controlled especially well with our QuasarMX HF ISO Reader, our QuasarMF Mifare Reader and many other HF readers available on the market. Alternatively, standard industrial IOs as can be found in many automation environments can also be used to control the multiplexer directly from a process control system.
