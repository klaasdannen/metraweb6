The Map-Plugin extends the visualization capabilities of the IoT Engine with a map based interface. Depending on the application, you can either integrate your own maps, e.g. a warehouse, or use street maps (using Open Street Maps) inside the IoT Engine. For this purpose the plugin supports custom maps in JPG or PNG. It is possible to have several maps in once configuration (multiple building, multiple floors, etc.)
With a “Google Maps”-like interface you can pan and zoom the map and switch between floors with a single click. You can click on a zone (part of a floor) to show all items in this area, use the search bar to search for a specific item (the map will automatically zoom to its location) or only show a filtered number of objects.
