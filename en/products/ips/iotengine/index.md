# IoT Engine Middleware
***

The IoT Engine middleware (IoT = Internet of Things) is a software that collects, filters and evaluates data from various sources. These can be different devices, such as RFID readers or an indoor positioning system (IPS), but also data from Barcode scanners, forklifts (current  speed) or entire machines (e.g., operating time).

In addition to this basic function, the program is used to configure devices in a network and to ensure the permanent operation of the entire system. The software monitors all registered components and sounds an alarm when a device is no longer available.

To ensure highest reliability, maximum flexibility and lowest cost a framework was developed which can be extended by smaller plugin. These plugins allow e.g. the transfer of the data to other systems (databases, web services, etc), the monitoring of movements (alarm module) or the implementation of a complete front-end with map visualization. Additionally there is the possibility to create plugins specifically for customers or to write own plugins if the customer has the necessary programming knowledge.
The advantage of the IoT Engine is that a standard software is used in your IoT projects, that has been proven to work in dozens of large scale applications instead of a custom software that is newly written (including new bugs) for every project.
