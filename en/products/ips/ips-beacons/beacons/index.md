One of the main technical advantages of the metraTec Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is the very low power consumption of the system. Thanks to the newest RF chip technology and our own firmware stack the Beacon S runs up to 2 years with a single cell battery.

Due to its size the Beacon S is meant to be use with persons that are tracked inside a building using our IPS Receivers.Typical applications are in the healthcare industry as well as in security applications.

The IPS Beacons automatically send out their configurable ID which can be processed by any IPS Receiver in the surrounding area and forwarded to a software. The range between beacon and receiver can be between a few meters and up to 60m, depending on the configuration. For tracking high value objects and assets, a bigger version of the IPS Beacon (Beacon L) with even longer battery life is the right choice.
