The Echo-5P is one of the most compact circularly polarized UHF RFID antennas (for 868 MHz) available on the market today. With a gain of approx. 5 dBic and an angular width of 100° the antenna may be operated with up to 500 mW ERP (according to ETSI 302 208) allowing reading distances of up to 3 m.

The size is only 90 x 105 x 20 mm not counting the SMA connector at the bottom. The housing is made from POM (polyoxymethylene) which has excellent mechanical properties and is resistant to many chemicals.

The antenna can be mounted directly to a wall using the two mounting holes. Alternatively, a wall bracket is available for increased flexibility in adjusting antenna alignment.
