The Indoor Positioning System (IPS) by metraTec is characterized on the technical side by its enormous power saving mode. Thanks to the use of state-of-the-art radio chips in combination with a completely rewritten firmware, a Beacon with a button cell can be operated for up to 5 years depending on the settings.
The IPS beacons are active transponders that send out their IDs in an adjustable interval. These signals are recognized by the appropriate IPS receivers and forwarded to our RTLS middleware "IoT-Engine". The reception range is between a few meters and 100m depending on the type of device.

The Beacon R is our most robust version for use in particularly demanding situations. The housing is made of 5mm thick plastic and the electronics are waterproof and shockproof encapsulated. The integrated battery lasts approx. 5 years with a signal every 20 seconds. Other beacons are also available, e.g. a larger version for objects (screwable, IP54, battery life min. 5 years) or a compact version for people (as key ring, IP41, battery life approx. 2 years).

The Beacon R can be used in the following applications, among others

* Localisation of vehicles at the depot
* Location of products and Work in Progress
* Presence detection of rental objects
