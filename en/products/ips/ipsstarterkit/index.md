# IPS Starter Kit
***

The easiest way to get started with indoor positioning technology is with our IPS Starter Kit. This contains all the components you need to set up and test a small indoor positioning system yourself:

two beacons - as desired in the small version for people or in the large version for objects and machines
two IPS receivers with Ethernet connection to receive the data (incl. 24V power supply, if no PoE is available) an IPS USB stick for quick measurement of signal strength and general debugging
Besides the hardware, the starter kit also includes a demo version of our IPS Engine software suite. With this, the IPS infrastructure can be configured completely graphically, so that the raw data of the system can then be written directly into a database (PostgreSQL or MySQL). This can be accessed by any programmer with his own software. Alternatively, own zones can be defined via the IoT Engine Middleware.

The demo version contains all the functions of the full version, but is limited to the operation of a maximum of three receivers.
