The fastest way to test our Indoor Positioning System (IPS) is with our IPS Starter Kits, which are available in a standard version and a Power over Ethernet (PoE) version. These kits include all components you need to evaluate our system and build a small IPS:

* Two beacons - chose between our Beacon S and Beacon L
* Two IPS Receivers to receive the signals - with 24V DC supply or PoE
* One IPS USB Stick to measure signal strengths and debugging

Besides the hardware, the kits also include a demo version of our IPS Engine Software Suite. This set of programs can be used to configure your system in a grafical user interface, start a server process which will collect all the data from the receivers and write it into a database (eg. PostgreSQL, MySQL or others) where you can access the data from your own program. Alternatively, a small visualization program is included in the package. This demo version includes all the features of the full version but is limited to three receivers at the same time.
