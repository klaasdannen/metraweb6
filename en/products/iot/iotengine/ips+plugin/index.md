In comparison to the IPS Plugin (zone location), the IPS+ Plugin in combination with the corresponding hardware enables XY-localization with an accuracy of approx. 0.5 m. The plugin can be used to manage and monitor the indoor positioning localization infrastructure and data flow. However, since IPS+ can be used for more precise localization, more precise information (position of the receivers in the building) must also be provided within IPS+ plugin. The use of the Map Plugin is therefore required with this plugin.
