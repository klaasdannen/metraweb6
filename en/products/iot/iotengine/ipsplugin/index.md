This plugin manages the infrastructure and data flow for a metraTec indoor positioning system (IPS). It is used to configure the receivers and beacons and checks the status of the hardware. With this plugin a user is able to define zones (smallest unit of localization). All Informations about the receivers and beacons (e.g. battery state) are logged and displayed in the form of a table in the dashboard. It also displays which beacons are currently in which zone (zone location). All tables (receiver list, beacon list, etc.) are searchable and can be exported in MS Excel or other external tools.
An application example is the location of a container in a certain area within a warehouse, e.g. within outgoing goods department.
