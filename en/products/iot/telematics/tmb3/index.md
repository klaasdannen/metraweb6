The TMB3 is the third genaration of telematics boxes made by metraTec. It features a modern NB-IoT and LTE-M modem for future connectivity as well as a state of the art GPS receiver. With the integrated IEEE 802.15.4 receiver this device can work as a moving receiver for our indoor positioning system (IPS) to combine indoor and outdoor tracking.

The device is directly powered by the vehicle battery at 10-30V and includes an internal battery for continued operation after the vehicle is stopped and power is cut. Additionally, the box has a 24V output which can be used to trigger an alarm or other event.

Installation of the box in the vehicle is easy and can be done in less than 10 minutes by any electrician.
