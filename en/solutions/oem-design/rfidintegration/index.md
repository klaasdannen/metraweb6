RFID has become a broad collective term for a multitude of different technologies. The metraTec development team will support you in integrating RFID into your product - starting with advice on the right frequency, the creation of carrier boards suitable for your task, right through to the approval process in the EU and beyond.

Benefit from our unique experience with projects in various industries: Starting with the integration of RFID modules in medical devices and laboratory equipment, through industrial devices to RFID in coffee machines and even in gold vending machines. Whether it's particularly small or particularly large, very short distance or extra long - the chances are good that we've already implemented a similar project once.

Contact us with your task and let us make you an offer for our RFID integration services.
